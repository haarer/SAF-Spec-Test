# User Documentation
System Architecture Framework Specification ![Bild](diagrams/Under_construction_icon-yellow.svg) **is work in progress**

This repository contains both documentation for users of SAF and developers of SAF. To understand how we develop SAF, see **[how SAF is developed](developing-saf/development.md). We always welcome contributions from our MBSE community to improve SAF, see [how to contribute to SAF](contributing.md).**

The System Architecture Framework Specification application is demonstrated using the **Fire Forest Detection System (FFDS)** example, courtesy of Tim Weilkiens. The Fire Forest Detection System example is based on the publication **SYSMOD - The Systems Modeling Toolbox, 3rd edition Pragmatic MBSE with SysML, Tim Weilkiens**
