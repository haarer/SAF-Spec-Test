The result of the Functional Domain viewpoint-oriented elaboration approach is a comprehensive System Specification.",

These Logical Elements and their Interactions are arranged in the Logical Architecture of the SOI. The structure of the Logical Architecture is in general influenced by Non-functional criteria, e.g., maintainability, reliability, safety, and security.",

  "Documentation" : "**Objective**\n\nThe SAF Physical Domain supports the representation of the Product Breakdown Structure, the identification of external and internal physical interfaces, the provision of viewpoints for the system overview, the integration planning, production planning, and the features and variations implied in the system. The physical architecture typically is a combination of re-use elements, COTS elements and make-items for HW as well as for SW. The properties of the selected physical components and their provided resources are identified and modeled. A major concern of the SAF Physical Domain are the physical interfaces, their identification and definition. For that purpose, the SAF Physical Domain provides the viewpoints to model interface with different level of detail considering the actual needs for the point of time in the project life cycle. For traceability the SAF Physical Domain defines viewpoints showing the mapping of the functional elements and their interfaces to physical elements and their interfaces.",
